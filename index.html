<h1>Bio</h1>
My name is Jeremy Thibeau. I'm from Moncton, New Brunswick and currently live in Toronto with my fiancee and our cat.
After graduating High School I went to university to pursue a Teaching Degree in Mathematics. I have been working at
Tangerine Bank for the last 5 years after graduating university in customer service, and for the last 2 years have
been studying at George Brown College as a Computer Programmer Analyst.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video and Trading Card Games. I hope one day to work as a game developer.
