<h1>Bio</h1>
My name is Jeremy Thibeau and I'm from Moncton, New Brunswick. I currently live in Toronto with my fiancée and our cat.
After graduating high school, I went to university to pursue my Bachelor of Arts and Education in Mathematics. I’ve been
working at Tangerine Bank for the past five years, and I’ve been studying at George Brown College as a Computer Programmer
Analyst for the past two years. In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and trading card games, and I hope one day
to work as a game developer.
