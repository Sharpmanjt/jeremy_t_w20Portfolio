<h1>Bio</h1>
My name is Jeremy Thibeau and I'm from Moncton, New Brunswick. I currently live in Toronto with my fiancée and our cat.
After graduating high school, I went to university to pursue my Bachelor of Arts and Education in Mathematics.
<p></p>
For the past five years, I've been working at Tangerine Bank in customer service. Through that, I've gained experience
addressing customer inquiries about their daily banking and loans, meeting expected deadlines, and resolving customer
complaints and issues. At George Brown College, I’ve studied programming with a focus on Agile Programming Methodologies.
I’ve worked with several different languages and technologies to make small scale applications and programs. For the next
step in my career, I want to work at the intersection of these two fields to work on improving software for evolving
customer needs. I believe the core of any business must be focused on the customer, and I want to put myself in their
shoes to create a best in class experience for them. My resume below summarizes my skills and education so far.
